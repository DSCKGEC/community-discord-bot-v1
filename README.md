## Introduction

A discord bot for the programming community, primarily for managing the discord server of DSC KGEC (to be made public soon!)

### Commands and Functionalities active

1. New user entry triggers the bot to DM the user asking his name and college and automatically assigning him the role of `KGECian` if the user is from our college!
2. Auto-assigning of roles to a user according to his/her emote reaction to a pinned server message.
3. Scraping [clist.by](https://clist.by) and [Events with Google](http://events.withgoogle.com/events) webpages for giving updates about latest and upcoming events and contests
4. **!add-event** is a command accessible to the server admins to create a new event announcement in a dedicated events channel.
5. **!submit-idea** helps the community members submit their event or project ideas up in a dedicated ideas channel.
6. **!report** to report any issue to the admins secretly.
7. And some other minor utility commands.

### Contributing
This is an open source project and allows anyone to add to the codebase. 
This project can be a good introduction to discord.js - if you are new to discord bot development or even have 0 past experience, we highly recommend you to go through this project and try to make your own command and send a PR!

If you are from a DSC community other than KGEC, we recommend you to add scraper functionalities to your community events so that we can partake in, expand our network and grow together.

Though web scraping is identified globally, some websites may have private pages or might have blocked web crawlers. Make sure you **do not** explicitly try to scrape data from those sites.
