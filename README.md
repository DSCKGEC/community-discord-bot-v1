### Contributing
This is an open source project and allows anyone to add to the codebase. 
This project can be a good introduction to discord.js - if you are new to discord bot development or even have 0 past experience, we highly recommend you to go through this project and try to make your own command and send a PR!

If you are from a DSC community other than KGEC, we recommend you to add scraper functionalities to your community events so that we can partake in, expand our network and grow together.

Though web scraping is identified globally, some websites may have private pages or might have blocked web crawlers. Make sure you **do not** explicitly try to scrape data from those sites.
